# Expert system to identify diseases in coffee plants

This is a small expert system that can be used to identify diseases in coffee plantations built using [experta](https://readthedocs.org/projects/experta/downloads/pdf/stable/) library. I referred the paper [Expert System in Detecting Coffee Plant Diseases](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270518363_Expert_System_in_Detecting_Coffee_Plant_Diseases) by Derwin Suhartono, Wahyu Aditya, Miranty Lestari, and Muhammad Yasin to generate the knowledge base for this program.

Identifiable Diseases
 - Coffee Leaf Rust
 - Nematode
 - Brown Eye Spot of Coffee
 - Upas Fungus
 - Brown Root Fungus
 - Black Root Fungus
 - White Root Fungus

I also referred the [code](https://github.com/ronak-07/Medical-Expert-System-Knowledge-Base) by ronak-07

Feel free to use this program to implement your own programs. 

Cheers !!
