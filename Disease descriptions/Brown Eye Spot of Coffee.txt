Brown Eye Spot of Coffee

The disease is caused by the fungus C. coffeicola that
may arise in the nursery to mature plants as well as
attacking the coffee fruit. Infected leaves emerge yellow
spots surrounded by yellow halo edges. This condition
can be seen in the image. Fruit which are attacked will raise a
brown spot, usually on the side that receives more
sunlight. These patches can be up to rot until the seed
resulting in low quality coffee.
